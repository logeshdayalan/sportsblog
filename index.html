		<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif; line-height: 1.4;color: #333; font-size: 1.3rem;"<b> Max Verstappen won the Las Vegas Grand Prix after initially disliking the excess and opulence of the event.</b> The event was filled with celebrities and entertainment but had a successful ending with Verstappen's victory and praise for the track. Despite some issues during practice, the race was considered one of the most lively of the season. Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez also had a strong race finishing second and third, respectively. A drain cover on the track drew the most attention by damaging Carlos Sainz's car severely in Free Practice 1 - resulting in a major delay and a 10-second penalty to Sainz for the damages that had to be fixed (stupid I know).</p>

Reese's absence follows her being benched in the previous game and Mulkey said it was "a coach's decision." Despite this, the team has a strong lineup and is expected to compete for a second consecutive national title.</p>

		<p> Storylines </p>
		<p> The Ravens picked up a win over the Bengals on Thursday Night Football, but the main story was the injury to Joe Burrow. Burrow has a right wrist injury that will keep him out for the rest of the season. It's a very unfortunate injury, as the Bengals had high hopes this season. </p>
		<p> Josh Allen and the Bills got back on track against the Jets on Sunday. Buffalo won 32-6. Allen had a strong performance, throwing for 275 yards and 3 touchdowns. The defense did a stellar job shutting down New York. With the win, the Bills are sitting at 6-5 and in the thick of the AFC playoff race.</p>
		<p>The Lions pulled off a tremendous comeback to beat the Bears 31-26. Detroit outscored Chicago 17-6 in the 4th quarter. Jared Goff had a tough day, throwing 3 interceptions, but he turned it on late and played his best when it mattered most. The Lions are now 8-2 and in firm control of the NFC North.</p>
		<p>Brock Purdy had himself a day against the Tampa Bay defense. Purdy went 21/25 with 333 yards and 3 touchdowns. The 49ers beat the Buccaneers 27-14. San Francisco went through some struggles a couple of weeks ago but they are back to being their dominant self. The 49ers are 7-3 and in first place in the NFC West.</p>

Travis looked to suffer a gruesome left leg/ankle injury in the Seminoles game against North Alabama. It appears Travis will be out for the year, but his injury status remains unknown.</p>
		<p>Georgia is playing some of the best football of their season in recent weeks. The Bulldogs dismantled Tennessee 38-10 on the road. That's as impressive as it gets against a solid Volunteer football team. Georgia outgained Tennessee by 195 yards.</p>
		<p>It may not always be pretty but Washington continues to win football games. The Huskies are a gutsy football team and it showed again on Saturday night. Washington went into Oregon State on a rainy night and picked up a 22-20 win. Michael Penix Jr. and company are now 11-0 on the year.</p>
		<p>Ohio State and Michigan both won on Saturday to set up their highly anticipated showdown. Ohio State crushed Minnesota at home 37-3, while Michigan did enough to beat Maryland 31-24. Next week's battle of the unbeaten's will take place in Ann Arbor.</p>
